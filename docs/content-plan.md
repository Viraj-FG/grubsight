# GrubSight Content Plan

## Content Strategy Overview

GrubSight's content should serve two purposes: **drive organic search traffic** (SEO) and **build brand authority** as the go-to food discovery platform. Every piece of content should include product links back to GrubSight category pages or individual product recommendations.

---

## Blog Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Best Of" Product Roundups (Primary SEO Driver)
These target high-intent buyer keywords and are the bread and butter of affiliate content.

| Blog Post | Target Keyword | Search Intent |
|---|---|---|
| "11 Best Japanese Snacks You Can Buy on Amazon (2026)" | best japanese snacks amazon | Transactional |
| "The 9 Best Korean Hot Sauces, Ranked" | best korean hot sauce | Transactional |
| "Best Mexican Spices & Seasonings for Authentic Cooking" | mexican spices for cooking | Transactional |
| "15 Best Indian Snacks to Order Online" | best indian snacks | Transactional |
| "Best Italian Pasta Brands on Amazon (Beyond Barilla)" | best italian pasta brands | Transactional |
| "The Best Plant-Based Snacks That Actually Taste Good" | best plant based snacks | Transactional |
| "10 Best Seafood Snacks & Dried Fish You Can Buy Online" | seafood snacks | Transactional |
| "Best Hot Sauces on Amazon: A Definitive Ranking" | best hot sauce amazon | Transactional |
| "Korean Pantry Essentials: Everything You Need" | korean pantry staples | Informational/Transactional |
| "Japanese Pantry Staples for Beginners" | japanese pantry essentials | Informational/Transactional |

**Format:** 1,500-2,500 words. Brief intro → product picks with photos, descriptions, why we chose it → buying tips. Each product links to Amazon via GrubSight affiliate tag.

**Publishing cadence:** 2-3 posts/month minimum. Prioritize by keyword difficulty and search volume.

### Pillar 2: Cuisine Starter Guides (Top-of-Funnel)
Educational content that captures people beginning to explore a new cuisine.

- "How to Stock a Korean Pantry: A Beginner's Guide"
- "Indian Cooking for Beginners: 7 Essential Ingredients"
- "Your First Japanese Cooking Haul: What to Buy"
- "Mexican Pantry 101: Beyond Taco Seasoning"
- "Italian Cooking Beyond Pasta Sauce: Ingredients Worth Discovering"

**Format:** 2,000-3,000 words. Ingredient education + product recommendations + recipe suggestions. These become cornerstone content pages.

### Pillar 3: Gift Guides (Seasonal Traffic Spikes)
High-intent, high-conversion content timed to holidays.

- "Best Japanese Food Gifts Under $25" (year-round, spike at Christmas)
- "Korean Snack Gift Box Ideas for K-Drama Fans"

- "Valentine's Day Food Gifts That Aren't Chocolate"
- "Lunar New Year Gift Guide: Asian Snacks & Treats"
- "Diwali Gift Guide: Indian Sweets & Snacks on Amazon"

### Pillar 4: "vs." and Comparison Content

- "Sriracha vs. Sambal Oelek: Which Should You Buy?"
- "Shin Ramyun vs. Buldak: The Korean Noodle Showdown"
- "San Marzano vs. Regular Canned Tomatoes: Worth the Price?"

## Recipe Tie-Ins

GrubSight shouldn't become a recipe blog, but **strategic recipe content** creates natural product links:

### Format: "Shop the Recipe"
Short recipes (300-500 words) where every ingredient links to a GrubSight-recommended product.

- **"Authentic Kimchi Jjigae — Shop Every Ingredient on Amazon"**
- **"5-Minute Japanese Breakfast Bowl"**
- **"Easy Weeknight Tacos al Pastor"**
- **"Quick Indian Dal with Pantry Staples"**
- **"10-Minute Cacio e Pepe"**

Each recipe page includes a "Shopping List" component linking to all recommended products.

## Social Media Strategy

### TikTok / Instagram Reels (Primary Growth Channel)
Food content crushes on short-form video. GrubSight doesn't need to cook — it needs to **unbox, taste-test, and react.**

**Content formats:**
1. **"Amazon Food Finds"** — unboxing interesting products, reaction-style (3-5x/week)
2. **"Cuisine in 60 Seconds"** — rapid-fire overview of a cuisine's key products
3. **"Would You Try This?"** — unusual/polarizing foods, engagement bait
4. **"Pantry Starter Pack"** — what to buy to cook [cuisine] at home
5. **"$30 Amazon Haul: [Cuisine] Edition"** — budget-constrained discovery
6. **Spice tier lists** — rank hot sauces, snacks, sauces from mild to extreme

**Hashtags:** #amazonfoodfinds #japanesesnacks #koreanfood #foodtiktok #snackreview #pantrystaples #fooddiscovery

### Pinterest (Evergreen Traffic Engine)
Pinterest is a search engine disguised as social media. Food is its #1 category.

**Board structure (mirrors site categories):**
- Japanese Food Finds
- Korean Pantry Essentials
- Best Mexican Ingredients
- Indian Cooking Staples
- Italian Food Favorites
- Spicy Food & Hot Sauces
- Snack Discovery
- Plant-Based Finds
- Gift Guides

**Pin strategy:**
- Create 5-10 pins per blog post with different images/headlines
- Tall pins (1000x1500px) with product photos on dark backgrounds (matches brand)
- Every pin links to GrubSight blog post or category page
- Use keyword-rich descriptions: "Best Japanese snacks to buy on Amazon | GrubSight curated picks"

**Cadence:** 10-15 pins/day (use Tailwind or similar scheduler)

### Reddit (Community + Traffic)
- Participate authentically in r/snackexchange, r/KoreanFood, r/JapaneseFood, r/spicy, r/hotsauce, r/Cooking
- Share expertise, link to GrubSight content when genuinely helpful
- **Do NOT spam** — Reddit will destroy you. Build reputation first.

### YouTube (Long-Form Discovery)
Lower priority initially, but high potential:
- "I Tried Every [Cuisine] Snack on Amazon" haul videos
- "Building a Japanese Pantry from Scratch on Amazon"
- Hot sauce ranking videos (Hot Ones style)
