## Differentiation Strategy

### What makes GrubSight different from everything else:

| vs. Amazon | GrubSight adds curation, editorial voice, cuisine-based browsing |
|---|---|
| vs. Subscription boxes | No commitment, buy individual items, choose your cuisine |
| vs. Recipe blogs | Product-first experience, organized discovery, not buried in a recipe |
| vs. Specialty grocers (Weee!, H Mart) | Nationwide via Amazon, discovery-focused not grocery-list |
| vs. Food52 | Focused on packaged food, not kitchenware; accessible pricing |
| vs. Thrive Market | No membership, cuisine-based not diet-based, global not just health |

### Brand Pillars
1. **Curation over selection** — 200 products > 200,000. Every product earns its spot.
2. **Cuisine as identity** — We organize by how people eat, not how warehouses stock.
3. **Discovery as joy** — Browsing GrubSight should feel like wandering through a global market.
4. **Amazon's convenience, our taste** — One-click ordering with editorial confidence.

## Brand Visual Identity Notes

Current design (dark theme #0A0A0A, orange #FF6B35, gold #FFD700) reads as premium/bold — good for a food brand with attitude. Recommendations:

- **Keep the dark theme** — differentiates from the sea of white-background food sites
- **Add cuisine-specific accent colors** on category pages (red for spicy, green for plant-based, deep blue for seafood)
- **Photography style:** Overhead flat-lays on dark backgrounds with dramatic lighting (matches the brand palette)
- **Icon system:** Custom illustrated icons for each cuisine category (not generic stock icons)
- **Consider adding a subtle texture** — dark linen or concrete — to avoid the "pure black void" feel
